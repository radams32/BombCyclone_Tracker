# BombCyclone_Tracker
This repository implements simple routines to identify and build trajectories for bomb cyclones in gridded datasets.

Simply, gridded sea-level pressure data can be assessed with this tracker to identify times and locations of closed low pressure systems. Further, it stitches them in time. The original code was optimized for tracking cyclones in the western North Atlantic Ocean basin. This repository will facilitate building upon it to globalize its utility and perhaps implement and extra layer to identification (i.e. mid-tropospheric vorticity). 

This will be a simple tool for anyone interesting in tracking ET cyclones in a gridded dataset on the MATLAB platform. It can be used for any resolution and globally.
